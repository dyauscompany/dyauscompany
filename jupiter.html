          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6" style="color: black">Jupiter is the largest planet, hence it's gravitational pull the highest among all planets.In other planetary systems, we see evidence that giant planets like Jupiter can migrate from where they originally formed, spiraling inward to an orbit closer to their stars. When these giants wander toward their stars, any small, rocky planets that stand in the way can be swallowed up or, due to the giants’ strong gravity, flung out of the star system altogether.

But if Jupiter-like planets remain distant from their stars, they can serve as the gatekeepers to their planetary systems. They protect their fellow planets on inner orbits, allowing them to maintain nearly circular orbits that provide stable climates over extended periods of time. Long, elliptical orbits cause extreme climate shifts for an Earth-like planet, possibly preventing any sort of sustained life from evolving.

In our solar system, Jupiter can eat up any asteroid or comet that ventures near, earning the nickname “vacuum cleaner of the solar system.” The asteroid belt in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter is another example of the gas giant’s influence. Its gravity likely prevented the asteroids from combining into a planet.

Jupiter can also radically alter the orbits of small bodies that stray close, hurling them on long orbits that take hundreds or even thousands of years for those bodies to return. We think this is how comets got the extreme orbits that carry them to the far-flung reaches of the solar system. They spend most of their time out there, forming a cometary collection called the Oort cloud, which may extend as far as halfway to the nearest star.

While Jupiter often protects Earth and the other inner planets by deflecting comets and asteroids, sometimes it sends objects on a collision course straight toward the inner planets. Earlier in the solar system’s history, when there were more objects flying around, the increased amount of impacts would have brought to Earth water and other ingredients for life. Of course, other collisions would have been disastrous, such as the impact that likely led to the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
